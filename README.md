# Containerized_XLX_Inputs
Basic Configuration files to support Containerized Digital XLX Inputs

This Repository contains configuration directories for Docker Container Images developed to provide digital voice inputs for XLX reflectors.  These inputs include inputs for YSF2DMR, P252DMR, NXDN2DMR.  Also presented here are configuration files for non-transcoded reflectors which stand-alone for YSF, P25, and NXDN

The container images are located at https://hub.docker.com/search?q=bauerjv&type=image .  The container contains the binaries of software which has been developed by others, and an operating system which in all cases is Ubuntu Linux.  The support files in each directory have been developed by others also, so my small development was done on the shoulders of giants who forged the software used.
